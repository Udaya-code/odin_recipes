    <p>
        This taco salad is made with taco-seasoned ground beef, chili beans, and tomatoes combined with cheese
    and crunchy tortilla chips for a tasty twist on regular taco salad. The children have fun preparing 
    all the extras before we mix it all together. Serve on lettuce and top with salsa and sour cream.
